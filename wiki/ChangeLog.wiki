I created a repository so please use it.

I am working on creating an XML configuration file, that will contain all of the constants that we will be using. I'll post more on this later. 

Also we need to make sure that everybody is working on something. So I'm going to be working on creating a controller that will try to align the queen with the XZ plane. As far as I know Smiral will be working on the scene, creating bounding volumes for the mountains etc. Ruhi there are two things I can think of for you right now. The camera controller, that makes the camera slide on the bounding volumes of the scene or the AI Framework. I think the camera controller is more urgent so would you like to work on that?
