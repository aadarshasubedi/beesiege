*21-Oct-2007* - _Vaios

I created a repository so please use it.

*24-Oct-2007* - _Vaios

I am working on creating an XML configuration file, that will contain all of the constants that we will be using. I'll post more on this later. 

Also we need to make sure that everybody is working on something. So I'm going to be working on creating a controller that will try to align the queen with the XZ plane. As far as I know Smiral will be working on the scene, creating bounding volumes for the mountains etc. Ruhi there are two things I can think of for you right now. The camera controller, that makes the camera slide on the bounding volumes of the scene or the AI Framework. I think the camera controller is more urgent so would you like to work on that?

*24-Oct-2007* - _Vaios

I added the [http://beesiege.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ConfigurationManager.cpp ConfigurationManager], which reads a configuration file which contains all of the  constant values that we use here and there. The configuration file is an XML file and its schema is configurationSchema.rng. This schema is written in RELAX NG, which is a type of validation language for XML. If you want to modify the XML file or add stuff to it, make sure you make the appropriate changes to the XML schema and validate it using jing. To run jing type the following: `jing configurationSchema.rng configuration.xml`.

Also I added a UML diagram of the classes we are using. It is an HTML file but it works only in Internet Explorer... (sry not my fault :P). So check that out if you want.

That's it for now.

*25-Oct-2007* - _Vaios

I changed the camera and character controllers so that the force is calculated correctly. Also I changed the way the camera moves. Now it doesn't rotate on its local z axis, but it only "strafes" on the y axis. This way we avoid the problem where the world is rotated.

I added a lot of things now. First of all the user can now select a number of bees by holding down the left mouse button and when the button is released the selected bees will go to a target. When the left button is pressed a counter is increased and when it is released the queen sorts the soldiers according to their distance from a target, using Merge Sort. Then the desired number goes to the target. Also when a bee is selected its color changes to green. 

I also added an enemy (Locust). The user can target an enemy and cycle through targets. Only the targets that are close to the queen can be selected. When an enemy is selected its color changes to red. A bee can go to an enemy if the queen commands it to do so, but the mechanism is not complete yet.

Finally (I think), I added a [http://beesiege.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/TextManager.cpp TextManager] which is used to display text on screen, and I currently use it to display the number of bees selected.

A major problem is performance. For some reason the game is crawling when we add more than ten PhysX objects and I cannot tell why this is happening. I have a strong feeling though that there is something wrong with PhysX...

So the issue with the performance was actually an issue with the camera, which is now fixed. I also changed the way we select soldiers, so now soldiers are selected one by one. Therefore there is no need for Merge Sort (thx Ruhi). Now I really need the FSM framework.

Also I replaced std::lists with NiTPointerLists. I think it's faster.

*28-Oct-2007* - _Vaios

I added 3D sound. It's not completely ready yet I'm just making sure the framework works fine. It's not bad...
